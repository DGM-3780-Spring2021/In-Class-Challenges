# In Class Challenges

For this assignment we will be working in groups to individually submit pull requests to this repo with commpleted challenges.

Each student is required to choose 3 challenges to complete and submit a pull request. You can't pick the same challenges as other students in your group.

The challenges are in the challenges.md file.

Create new .js files with submitted code. Use your first name for the name of the file. (IE landon.js) HTML files aren't required, but if that is something that helps you they are ok.
